<blockquote>
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
- Romans 1:20-21

<h3>The Master of the House</h3>
<p>Are there many paths to God? You would hope so, but the short answer is simply, No.</p>
<p>Let's say I invited you over for Thanksgiving dinner: whose house will you be entering? My house. It then begs the question, whose rules ought you to be mindful of? My rules. While you are indeed my guest, it does not mean I'm giving you the liberty to do whatever you want and the same holds true when you have me over to your house.</p>
<p>Such a silly example, and yet it profoundly demonstrates a key principle that scores of people have somehow neglected: If you have any hope of entering God's Heaven, you're going to have to do so God's way, not your way.</p>
<h3>The Door of the House</h3>
<p>So how exactly does one get to "go to Heaven?" Simple: use the front door!</p>
<ul>
  <li>John 10:7-11 - Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</li>
  <li>John 14:5-6 - Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</li>
  <li>Acts 4:12 - Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</li>
  <li>1 John 5:11-12 - And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; [and] he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Open House</h3>
<p>As it says in 2 Peter 3:9, The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."</p>
<p>God invites you to come on in! "But how? what do I do?"</p>
<h4>Repent and believe the gospel!</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Romans 3:23 - For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</li>
  <li>Romans 6:23 - For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</li>
  <li>John 3:16-18 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</li>
  <li>Luke 5:31-32 - And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</li>
  <li>Romans 10:9 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</li>
  <li>Romans 10:13 - For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</li>
</ul>
<p>All it takes for you to know for sure that you'll go to Heaven when you die is to believe that Jesus Christ, God's only begotten Son, died upon the cross of Calvary for your sins, was buried, and rose again from the dead; repent of your sins and call upon the Lord Jesus Christ in believing faith, asking him to forgive you of your sins, and to come into your heart and to save your soul.</p>
<blockquote>
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. - 1 John 5:13
