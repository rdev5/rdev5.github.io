Are there multiple ways to God? In a sense, yes. People find themselves in every sort of situation which God is able to use to "introduce" himself.

But when we're talking about what it takes for a person to get to heaven, God makes it clear: there is **only one way** to gain entrance.

### The Master of the House
Assuming you came over for Thanksgiving dinner: you would be entering my house and thus must be subject to my rules. The same holds true when you have me over to your house. This is a very simple principle that is not merely neglected; it is often *forsaken*.

> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, [even] his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
> <br />&mdash; Romans 1:20-21

This principle must *sanitize* our ideas of entering into God's heaven. If you want in, you're going to have to come by God's standard, not yours.

### The Door of the House

So how exactly does one get to "go to Heaven?" Simple: use the front door!

- John 10:7-11 - Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, **I am the door of the sheep.** All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
- John 14:5-6 - Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, **I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.**
- Acts 4:12 - Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
- 1 John 5:11-12 - And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; [and] he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.

### The Open House

As it says in 2 Peter 3:9, The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."

God invites you to come on in! "But how? what do I do?"
#### Realize you're a sinner and repent
- Luke 13:3-5 - And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
- Romans 3:23 - For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

What does it mean to *repent*?
- To feel pain, sorrow, or regret for sin, as a violation of God's holy law, a dishonor to his character and government, and the foulest ingratitude to a Being of infinite benevolence.
- To change the mind in consequence of the inconvenience or injury done by past conduct.

There is hope, but first, let me ask you this: do you realize what you've done to dishonor God? Will you now forsake it? If so...

#### Believe that Jesus Christ died to pay your sin debt
- Romans 5:8 - But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
- Romans 6:23 - For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
- John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

#### Call upon the risen Christ to save you!
- Romans 10:9 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
- Romans 10:13 - For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

### The Closing House
With no guarantee of tomorrow, it would be wise and prudent for you to settle what can be guaranteed today today.
> ...behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation. (2 Corinthians 6:2)

You can know for sure you're on your way to heaven when you've repented and called upon the Lord Jesus Christ in believing faith, asking him to forgive you of your sins, and come into your heart and save your soul.
> These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. - 1 John 5:13
